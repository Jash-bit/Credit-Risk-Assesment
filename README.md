# Credit-Risk-Assesment
Credit risk is nothing but the default in payment of any loan by the borrower. In Banking sector this is an important factor to be considered before approving the loan of an applicant.
This Project looks to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on customer detail provided while filling online application form. These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others. 
To automate this process, we have been given a problem to identify the customers segments, those are eligible for loan amount so that they can specifically be targeted.
